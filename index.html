              Hello, my name is Averette Johnson, my friends call me Avery.
              I am a currently enrolled student at Flatiron School.
              I am so excited to jumpstart my career in software engineering.
              I have been inspired by the works of Hidetaka Miyazaki and his amazing creation, Dark Souls.
              Video games have been a major part of my life and this has led to me being fascinated by technology.
              Leading to me wanting to learn the inter-workings of the software that everything runs on.
